# Scriptify
## Generating new scripts for the Simpsons
Generates your own [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV scripts using RNNs.  This'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.  The Neural Network built will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).

## Dependencies
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Usage </br>
Run the python file or the jupyter notebook to get started </br>
### Note:Training Neural Networks takes a lot of time and usage of GPU or cloud services is highly recommended

## Output
moe_szyslak: ya, i think boy, thank you, too actually a nigerian drive of new street in a sea drink" park by" like me here...(to barflies on") no shut lenny.</br>
waylon_smithers: here's to dr. a" in a pockets, to hurt"" / where would you been your butt of the s they drink to say in of"."(to homer) when i spend a date for less on a ring.</br>
moe_szyslak: to take her you or ya like a family ago in" / so i won't join together with alcohol next in the noble best her here. i'm just the more fight.</br>

lenny_leonard:(to" singing) your infatuation is gonna been in ya!</br>

* The network learns words and the English grammar and language
* If provided with a bigger dataset and more training time,the output would have been clearer and more understandable
